# Maze Game in VHDL

This is a maze game project written in VHDL, for Bogazici University EE244 Digital Systems Design class, colloborated with 
my colleague Beril Umar.

This project is implemented on Xilinx Nexys3 and visualized on a CRT monitor, using VGA.

Aim of the game is simple: Users are expected to control the ball towards the target area using the board's four push buttons (which controls up, down, right and left) without touching the walls.
